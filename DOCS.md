## 1. Architecture Overview

### What runs inside the add-on

The add-on container runs three services:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenClaw Gateway** | 18789 (configurable) | The AI agent server — handles skills, chat, automations |
| **nginx** (Ingress proxy) | 48099 (fixed) | Serves the landing page inside Home Assistant |
| **ttyd** (Web terminal) | 7681 (configurable) | Provides a browser-based terminal for setup and management |

When you open the add-on page in Home Assistant, nginx serves a landing page with:
- An **Open Gateway Web UI** button (opens in a new tab to avoid WebSocket issues with Ingress)
- An embedded **terminal** for running commands

### Key directories

| Path | Persistent? | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `/config/` | Yes | All user data — survives add-on updates and rebuilds |
| `/config/.openclaw/` | Yes | OpenClaw configuration (`openclaw.json`), skills, agent data |
| `/config/clawd/` | Yes | Agent workspace (ClawHub-installed skills, files) |
| `/config/.node_global/` | Yes | User-installed npm packages (skills installed via dashboard) |
| `/config/secrets/` | Yes | Tokens (e.g., `homeassistant.token`) |
| `/config/keys/` | Yes | SSH keys (e.g., router SSH key) |
| `/config/.linuxbrew/` | Yes | Homebrew install and brew-installed CLI tools |
| `/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/` | No | OpenClaw installation (rebuilt with each image update) |

> **Important**: Everything under `/config/` persists across add-on updates. The container filesystem (`/usr/`, `/opt/`, etc.) is rebuilt each time the image changes.

## 2. Installation

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on store**
2. Click ⋮ (top-right) → **Repositories** → paste one of:
   - **Stable**: `https://github.com/techartdev/OpenClawHomeAssistant`
   - **Dev/Experimental**: `https://github.com/techartdev/OpenClawHomeAssistant-dev`
3. Find and install **OpenClaw Assistant**
4. Click **Start**

**Supported architectures**: amd64, aarch64 (Raspberry Pi 4/5), armv7

---

## 3. First-Time Setup

### What happens on first boot

When the add-on starts for the first time, it automatically:
1. Creates persistent directories under `/config/`
2. Generates a minimal `openclaw.json` with a random gateway auth token
3. Syncs built-in skills to persistent storage
4. Starts the gateway, terminal, and nginx

### Step 1 — Run onboarding

Open the add-on page in Home Assistant. You'll see a landing page with an embedded terminal.

In the terminal, run:

```sh
openclaw onboard
```

This interactive wizard walks you through connecting your AI providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.) and basic configuration.

Alternatively, for more granular control:

```sh
openclaw configure
```

### Step 2 — Get your Gateway token

The gateway requires a token for authentication. To retrieve it:

```sh
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
```

Save this token — you'll need it to access the Gateway Web UI and for API integrations.

### Step 3 — Verify everything works

1. In the terminal, confirm the gateway is running:
   ```sh
   openclaw gateway status
   ```
2. Click the **Open Gateway Web UI** button on the landing page
3. If prompted for a token, paste the one from Step 2 or go to the Overview tab, paste the token in the 'Gateway Token' field and press Connect.

---

## 4. Accessing the Gateway Web UI

The Gateway Web UI (Control UI) is OpenClaw's main web interface. It opens in a **separate browser tab** because Home Assistant's Ingress proxy has WebSocket limitations.

### Setting up the "Open Gateway Web UI" button

Set `gateway_public_url` in the add-on configuration to the URL where the gateway is reachable from your browser.

**Examples**:
- LAN: `http://192.168.1.119:18789`
- Public HTTPS: `https://example.duckdns.org:12345`

The button opens: `<gateway_public_url>/?token=<your_token>`

### How to make the Gateway reachable

Choose the method that fits your setup:

#### Method A — HTTPS via reverse proxy (recommended)

If you use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx Proxy Manager, Caddy, Traefik, Cloudflare Tunnel), configure it to also forward the gateway port (default 18789) with HTTPS. This is the most secure option and avoids browser security warnings.

> **Note**: Nabu Casa remote access only proxies the Home Assistant UI (port 8123) — it cannot forward custom ports like 18789. The add-on's Ingress page (landing + terminal) works through Nabu Casa, but the Gateway Web UI requires a reverse proxy or LAN access.

#### Method B — LAN HTTP access (most common)

Enable LAN access via the add-on configuration:

1. Go to **Settings → Add-ons → OpenClaw Assistant → Configuration**
2. Set:
   - `gateway_bind_mode`: **lan**
   - `gateway_port`: **18789** (or your preferred port)
   - `allow_insecure_auth`: **true** (required for HTTP — see below)
   - `gateway_public_url`: `http://<your-ha-ip>:18789`
3. Restart the add-on

#### Method C — SSH port forwarding (secure, no config changes)

Forward the gateway port from your HA host to your local machine:

```sh
ssh -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 your-user@your-ha-ip
```

Then open `http://localhost:18789` in your browser. No need to change `gateway_bind_mode` or `allow_insecure_auth`.

### Browser security: "requires HTTPS or localhost"

Modern browsers block certain features on plain HTTP (non-localhost). If you see this error:

> control ui requires HTTPS or localhost (secure context)

**Solutions** (pick one):
- **Use HTTPS** (Method A above) — best long-term
- **Use SSH port forwarding** (Method C above) — `localhost` counts as secure
- **Enable `allow_insecure_auth`** — quick workaround for LAN HTTP access

### Unauthorized error

If the Gateway UI shows **Unauthorized**, re-check your token:

```sh
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
```

## 5. Configuration Reference

All options are set via **Settings → Apps/Add-ons → OpenClaw Assistant → Configuration** in Home Assistant. They are applied automatically on each add-on restart.

### General

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `timezone` | string | `Europe/Sofia` | Timezone for the add-on (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`) |

### Gateway

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gateway_mode` | `local` / `remote` | `local` | **local**: run gateway in this add-on. **remote**: connect to an external gateway |
| `gateway_bind_mode` | `loopback` / `lan` | `loopback` | **loopback**: 127.0.0.1 only (secure). **lan**: all interfaces (LAN-accessible). Only applies when `gateway_mode` is `local` |
| `gateway_port` | int | `18789` | Port for the gateway. Only applies when `gateway_mode` is `local` |
| `gateway_public_url` | string | _(empty)_ | Public URL for the "Open Gateway Web UI" button. Example: `http://192.168.1.119:18789` |
| `enable_openai_api` | bool | `false` | Enable the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Required for [Assist pipeline integration](#6c-assist-pipeline-integration-openai-api) |
| `allow_insecure_auth` | bool | `false` | Allow HTTP (non-HTTPS) authentication on LAN. **Required** for browser access over plain HTTP |

### Terminal

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enable_terminal` | bool | `true` | Show the web terminal on the add-on page |
| `terminal_port` | int | `7681` | Port for the terminal (ttyd). Change if 7681 conflicts. Range: 1024-65535 |

### Security & Tokens

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `homeassistant_token` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional HA long-lived access token (use at own risk, can be very unsecure but very powerful). Saved to `/config/secrets/homeassistant.token` for use by scripts/skills |

| `router_ssh_user` | string | _(empty)_ | SSH username |
| `router_ssh_key_path` | string | `/data/keys/router_ssh` | Path to the private key inside the container |

To provide the SSH key: place the private key file in the add-on config directory so it appears at the configured path inside the container. Set permissions: `chmod 600`. (use at own risk, can be very unsecure but very powerful)

### Maintenance

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clean_session_locks_on_start` | bool | `true` | Remove stale session lock files on startup (safe — only removes locks when gateway isn't running) |
| `clean_session_locks_on_exit` | bool | `true` | Remove session lock files on clean shutdown |

---

## 6. Use Case Guides

### 6a. LAN Access Setup

This is the most common setup — accessing the Gateway Web UI from a browser on your local network.

1. Go to **Settings → Add-ons → OpenClaw Assistant → Configuration**
2. Set these options:

| Option | Value |
|---|---|
| `gateway_bind_mode` | **lan** |
| `gateway_port` | **18789** |
| `allow_insecure_auth` | **true** |
| `gateway_public_url` | `http://<your-ha-ip>:18789` |

3. Restart the add-on
4. Open the **Open Gateway Web UI** button — it should now work from any device on your LAN

**Security note**: `allow_insecure_auth` allows authentication over plain HTTP. This is fine on a trusted home network but should not be used over the internet. For public access, use HTTPS.

### 6b. Remote Gateway Mode

If you have an OpenClaw gateway running on a different machine (e.g., a more powerful server), you can configure this add-on to connect to it instead of running its own.

1. Set `gateway_mode`: **remote**
2. In the add-on terminal, configure the remote gateway URL:
   ```sh
   openclaw config set gateway.url <remote-gateway-url>
   ```
3. Restart the add-on

When `gateway_mode` is `remote`:
- The add-on does **not** start a local gateway process
- `gateway_bind_mode` and `gateway_port` are ignored
- The terminal and landing page still work normally
- You still need the remote gateway's auth token

### 6c. Assist Pipeline Integration (OpenAI API)

OpenClaw's Gateway exposes an **OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint** (`POST /v1/chat/completions`). This lets you use OpenClaw as a **conversation agent** in Home Assistant's Assist pipeline — enabling voice control, automations, and smart home commands.

#### Prerequisites

- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed on your Home Assistant
- [Extended OpenAI Conversation](https://github.com/jekalmin/extended_openai_conversation) integration

#### Step 1 — Enable the endpoint

In the add-on configuration, set `enable_openai_api`: **true**, then restart.

Or via terminal:
```sh
openclaw config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
```

#### Step 2 — Install Extended OpenAI Conversation

1. In HACS, add as a custom repository:
   - Repository: `https://github.com/jekalmin/extended_openai_conversation`
   - Category: **Integration**
2. Install and restart Home Assistant

#### Step 3 — Configure the integration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
2. Search for **Extended OpenAI Conversation**
3. Configure:
   - **API Key**: your gateway token (`openclaw config get gateway.auth.token`)
   - **Base URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1`
   - **API Version**: leave empty
   - **Organization**: leave empty
   - **Skip Authentication**: **true**

> If using `gateway_bind_mode: lan`, you can also use `http://<your-ha-ip>:18789/v1` — this allows other HA instances on your network to connect too.

#### Step 4 — Set as conversation agent

1. Go to **Settings → Voice Assistants**
2. Edit your assistant (or create a new one)
3. Under **Conversation agent**, select **Extended OpenAI Conversation**

#### Step 5 — Expose entities

Go to **Settings → Voice Assistants → Expose** and toggle on the entities you want OpenClaw to control.

You can now use Assist (voice or text) and OpenClaw will handle conversations, control devices, answer questions, and create automations.

### 6d. Browser Automation (Chromium)

The add-on includes **Chromium** for browser-based automation tasks. OpenClaw can use it for web scraping, form filling, website testing, and other browser automation skills.

To enable it, add to `/config/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "enabled": true,
    "headless": true,
    "noSandbox": true
  }
}
```

> **Note**: `noSandbox` is required inside Docker containers due to security namespace restrictions.

### 6e. Router / Network Device SSH

If you have skills or scripts that need SSH access to a router, firewall, or other network device:

1. Generate an SSH key pair (if you don't have one):
   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /config/keys/router_ssh -N ""
   ```
2. Copy the public key to your router:
   ```sh
   cat /config/keys/router_ssh.pub
   ```
   Add it to the router's authorized keys.
3. Configure the add-on options:
   - `router_ssh_host`: your router's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
   - `router_ssh_user`: SSH username (e.g., `admin`)
   - `router_ssh_key_path`: `/config/keys/router_ssh` (or wherever you saved it)
4. Test from the terminal:
   ```sh
   ssh -i /config/keys/router_ssh admin@192.168.1.1
   ```

The connection details are also saved to `/config/CONNECTION_NOTES.txt` for reference by scripts.

## 7. Data Persistence & Skills

### What persists across add-on updates

| Data | Location | Persists? |
|---|---|---|
| OpenClaw config | `/config/.openclaw/openclaw.json` | Yes |
| Built-in skills | `/config/.openclaw/skills/` | Yes |
| Agent sessions & data | `/config/.openclaw/agents/` | Yes |
| ClawHub workspace | `/config/clawd/` | Yes |
| User-installed npm skills | `/config/.node_global/` | Yes |
| SSH keys | `/config/keys/` | Yes |
| Tokens | `/config/secrets/` | Yes |
| Homebrew & brew-installed tools | `/config/.linuxbrew/` | Yes (synced on startup) |
| OpenClaw binary | `/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/` | **No** — reinstalled from image |

### How built-in skills work

OpenClaw ships with premade skills (e.g., web search, file management). On each startup, the add-on:

1. Copies built-in skills from the image to `/config/.openclaw/skills/`
2. Creates a symlink from the image path back to persistent storage
3. On subsequent boots, only newer files are synced (existing files are preserved)

This means built-in skills survive image rebuilds, and any customizations you make to skill files are preserved.

### How user-installed skills work

When you install a skill via the OpenClaw dashboard or `npm install -g`, the add-on redirects global npm installs to `/config/.node_global/`. This directory persists across updates.

The add-on also configures `pnpm` global directory to persistent storage at `/config/.node_global/pnpm/`.

### Homebrew-installed tools

Homebrew (Linuxbrew) and all brew-installed CLI tools (e.g., `gemini`, `aider`, `gh`, `bw`) are now **persisted** across add-on updates. On each startup, the add-on:

1. Syncs the image's Homebrew install to `/config/.linuxbrew/`
2. Creates a symlink from `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/` to the persistent copy
3. On subsequent boots, only newer files are synced (user-installed packages are preserved)

This means `brew install` packages survive image rebuilds.

---

## 8. Bundled Tools

The add-on image includes these tools, available in the terminal:

| Tool | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Git | `git` | Version control |
| Vim | `vim` | Text editor |
| Nano | `nano` | Text editor (beginner-friendly) |
| bat | `bat` (alias for `batcat`) | Syntax-highlighted `cat` |
| fd | `fd` (alias for `fdfind`) | Fast file finder |
| ripgrep | `rg` | Fast text search |
| curl | `curl` | HTTP client |
| jq | `jq` | JSON processor |
| Python 3 | `python3` | Scripting |
| Node.js 22 | `node` | JavaScript runtime |
| npm | `npm` | Node package manager |
| pnpm | `pnpm` | Fast Node package manager |
| Homebrew | `brew` | Package manager (optional — may not be available on all CPUs) |
| Chromium | `chromium` | Headless browser for automation |
| SSH | `ssh` | Remote access |

---

## 9. Updating & Backup

### Updating the add-on

Home Assistant checks for add-on updates automatically. When an update is available:

1. Go to **Settings → Add-ons → OpenClaw Assistant**
2. Click **Update**
3. The add-on will rebuild with the new image

**What happens during an update**:
- The container is destroyed and recreated from the new image
- Everything under `/config/` is preserved (config, skills, workspace, keys)
- Homebrew and brew-installed packages are preserved (synced to `/config/.linuxbrew/`)
- The OpenClaw binary is updated to the version in the new image

### Checking your version

The add-on version is shown on the add-on page in Home Assistant. To check the OpenClaw version:

```sh
openclaw --version
```

### Backup

Home Assistant's built-in backup system automatically includes add-on configuration data (`/config/`). This covers all persistent data: OpenClaw config, skills, workspace, keys, and tokens.

**To create a backup**: Go to **Settings → System → Backups → Create Backup**

**Manual backup** (from the terminal):
```sh
# Key paths to back up:
# /config/.openclaw/     - OpenClaw config, skills, agent data
# /config/clawd/         - ClawHub workspace
# /config/.node_global/  - User-installed npm skills
# /config/keys/          - SSH keys
# /config/secrets/       - Tokens
```

### Factory reset

To reset the add-on to a clean state, remove the persistent data:

```sh
rm -rf /config/.openclaw /config/clawd /config/.node_global
```

Then restart the add-on. It will re-bootstrap a fresh configuration.

> **Warning**: This deletes all your OpenClaw configuration, skills, and workspace data. Back up first if needed.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### How to read add-on logs

Go to **Settings → Add-ons → OpenClaw Assistant → Log** tab. Logs show startup messages, errors, and service status.

### Port 48099 conflict (add-on page won't load)

**Symptom**: `bind() to 0.0.0.0:48099 failed (98: Address already in use)` in logs.

**Cause**: A stale nginx process from a previous run is still holding the port. This can happen after a crash or unclean restart.

**Fix**: Restart the add-on. The startup script automatically cleans up stale processes. If the problem persists, stop the add-on, wait 10 seconds, then start it again.

### Port 7681 conflict (terminal won't load)

**Symptom**: `lws_socket_bind: ERROR on binding fd to port 7681` in logs.

**Fix**: Either restart the add-on (stale process cleanup), or change `terminal_port` to a different value (e.g., `7682`).

### ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

**Symptom**: Browser shows connection refused when opening the Gateway Web UI.

**Checks**:
1. Is the gateway running? In the terminal: `openclaw gateway status`
2. Is the bind mode correct? `openclaw config get gateway.bind` — must be `lan` for LAN access
3. Is the port correct? `openclaw config get gateway.port`
4. Is the firewall blocking the port? Check your HA host firewall rules

### Gateway UI shows "Unauthorized"

**Fix**: Get the correct token and use it:

```sh
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
```

Paste this token when the UI prompts for authentication, or append it to the URL: `http://<ip>:18789/?token=<your-token>`

### Terminal not visible

1. Check that `enable_terminal` is **true** in the add-on configuration
2. Check logs for `Starting web terminal (ttyd)` — if missing, the terminal is disabled
3. If you see a port conflict error, change `terminal_port` to a different value

### Skills disappearing after update

Built-in skills are synced to persistent storage on each startup. If skills are missing:

1. Check logs for `INFO: Synced built-in skills to persistent storage` — this confirms the sync ran
2. If you see `WARN: Built-in skills directory not found`, the OpenClaw installation may be corrupted. Try reinstalling the add-on.
3. User-installed skills (via dashboard) are stored in `/config/.node_global/` and should survive updates

### Homebrew errors / CPU compatibility

**Symptom**: `Homebrew's x86_64 support on Linux requires a CPU with SSSE3 support!`

**Cause**: Your CPU doesn't support SSSE3 instructions (required by Homebrew). Affects older Intel Atom, Celeron, or pre-2006 processors.

**Impact**: Skills that depend on Homebrew-installed CLI tools (e.g., `gemini`, `aider`) won't work. Core OpenClaw functionality is unaffected.

**Workarounds**:
- Use a machine with a newer CPU (Intel Core 2 or newer, ~2006+)
- Install the required CLI tools manually if possible
- Use alternative skills that don't require Homebrew dependencies

### "openclaw: command not found"

The OpenClaw binary should be installed at `/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/`. If this error appears:

1. Check the add-on logs for npm installation errors during build
2. Try restarting the add-on
3. If the problem persists, uninstall and reinstall the add-on

### Gateway won't start / config errors

**Symptom**: `ERROR: Failed to apply gateway settings` in logs.

**Fix**: The `openclaw.json` config file may be corrupted. To reset it:

```sh
rm /config/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Restart the add-on — it will generate a fresh config. You'll need to run `openclaw onboard` again.

## 11. FAQ

**Does this work on Raspberry Pi?**
Yes. The add-on supports aarch64 (Raspberry Pi 4/5) and armv7 (Raspberry Pi 3). Note that Homebrew may not work on all ARM devices, but core functionality is unaffected.

**Can I run multiple agents?**
OpenClaw supports multiple agent profiles. Configure them via `openclaw configure` or by editing `/config/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. The gateway serves all configured agents.

**Can I use a remote gateway?**
Yes. Set `gateway_mode` to `remote` and configure the remote gateway URL via `openclaw config set gateway.url <url>`. See [Remote Gateway Mode](#6b-remote-gateway-mode).

**How do I change the AI model or provider?**
Run `openclaw configure` in the terminal to reconfigure your AI providers, or edit `/config/.openclaw/openclaw.json` directly. You can use OpenAI, Google (Gemini), Anthropic (Claude), local models, and more.

**Can other devices on my network use the OpenClaw API?**
Yes, if you set `gateway_bind_mode` to `lan`. Any device on your network can connect to `http://<ha-ip>:18789`. Use the gateway token for authentication. This also enables the [Assist pipeline integration](#6c-assist-pipeline-integration-openai-api) from other HA instances.

**Where is my data stored on the host?**
The add-on's `/config/` directory maps to `/addon_configs/<slug>/` on the Home Assistant host. This is included in HA backups automatically.
